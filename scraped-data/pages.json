          "Welcome to our world of cultural exploration! I'm so glad you are here.",
          "I am Krithika. I play many roles in life, but the one I'm most proud of is to be the mother to my two lovely, beautiful daughters Aarna & Aira. As a new mother, I soon found myself teaching my young girls about the rich cultural heritage of the land I come from - India (Bharat), and telling them stories about our mythology, our many Gods and Goddesses.",
          "I soon realized that most products - books, games, and related products did not spark curiosity in children to learn more about India, and did not evoke pride in our rich civilization. This drove me to write my first Children's Illustration book \"My Marvelous Hindu Deities\", which quickly became a favorite with my kids, and many others like them.",
          "Encouraged by the book's popularity, and driven by a deep sense of passion for sharing our rich South Asian heritage & culture with the rest of the world, I created Roots On Rise, a platform to unveil cultural treasures through playful learning and personal discovery.",
          "Our products are designed to bring engaging and immersive experiences into our homes, and cultivate a deep connection to our collective roots, mythology and history.",
          "Join us on this exciting adventure as we craft products that not only entertain but also serve as windows into the vibrant tapestry of rich traditions. Together, let's nurture a global community of young learners who celebrate their rich cultural identities!",
          "Thanks for joining us."

It's a really fun way for children to learn about our culture. The illustrations are so adorable and pleasing - especially for the age group between 2 to 8 years old! Having 4 nieces and 1 nephew myself, I plan to buy more copies for them.",
