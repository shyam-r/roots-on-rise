Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Now say it slowly: **Oooommmmm...**

Did you feel that vibration? That's the sound of **Om** — the most sacred sound in Hinduism. Hindus believe it's the very first sound that ever existed, the sound that created the entire universe!

## What Is Om?

Om (also written as **Aum**) isn't just a word — it's three sounds blended together:

- **A** (aah) — the beginning, like waking up
- **U** (ooh) — the middle, like the daytime
- **M** (mmm) — the ending, like falling asleep

Together, they represent everything that ever was, is, and will be. Pretty powerful for three little sounds!

## Why Do People Chant Om?

When you chant Om, your whole body vibrates gently. It's like giving your mind a warm hug. People chant Om to:

- **Feel calm** — It's like a reset button for your brain
- **Start prayers** — Almost every Hindu prayer begins with Om
- **Connect with the universe** — The vibration reminds us we're all part of something bigger

Try it with your family! Sit together, close your eyes, and chant Om three times. Notice how peaceful the room feels afterward.

## The Om Symbol

You've probably seen the beautiful Om symbol — that curvy shape that looks a bit like the number 3 with a tail and a dot on top. Each part has meaning:

- The **curves** represent waking, dreaming, and deep sleep
- The **dot** represents the peaceful state beyond all three
- The **semicircle** separates the dot — reminding us that peace takes practice

The Om symbol is found everywhere in Hindu culture — on temples, jewelry, books, and art. It's one of the most recognized symbols in the world!

## Om Is Everywhere

Scientists have discovered that the universe actually does hum with a vibration — and some say it sounds a lot like Om! Whether it's the buzzing of bees, the rhythm of ocean waves, or the beating of your heart, the universe is full of vibrations.

When you chant Om, you're joining that cosmic song.
