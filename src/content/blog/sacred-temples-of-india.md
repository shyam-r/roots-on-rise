What if there were buildings so beautiful and so sacred that people travel thousands of miles just to visit them? Hindu temples are exactly that — incredible places where families go to pray, celebrate, and feel close to the gods.

## What Is a Hindu Temple?

A Hindu temple (called a **mandir**) is a special place built as a home for the gods on Earth. Hindus believe that when a temple is built with love and devotion, the deity actually comes to live there!

Every temple has a central room called the **garbhagriha** (which means "womb chamber") where the main deity's image is kept. This is the holiest part of the temple.

## Kedarnath: The Temple in the Clouds

High up in the **Himalayan mountains**, surrounded by snow-capped peaks and glaciers, sits **Kedarnath Temple** — one of the most sacred Shiva temples in all of India.

What makes Kedarnath incredible:

- It's at **11,755 feet** above sea level — that's higher than most clouds!
- It's over **1,000 years old**, built from massive gray stone blocks
- You can only reach it by **trekking 16 kilometers** through mountain trails — no roads go there
- It's open only **six months a year** because snow buries it in winter
- In 2013, a devastating flood destroyed everything around it, but the temple survived — protected by a giant boulder that diverted the water

People say Lord Shiva himself protects this temple. Looking at its story, it's hard to disagree!

## Mount Kailash: Shiva's Heavenly Home

**Mount Kailash** isn't just any mountain — Hindus believe it's the place where **Lord Shiva** sits in meditation with Goddess Parvati. It's considered the most sacred mountain in the world.

Amazing facts about Kailash:

- It's **21,778 feet tall**, in a remote corner of Tibet
- **No one has ever climbed to the top** — out of respect, climbing is not allowed
- Its shape is almost perfectly **symmetrical**, like a giant pyramid
- Four major rivers of Asia begin near Kailash
- Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains all consider it sacred

Instead of climbing, devotees walk around the base of Mount Kailash — a journey called **parikrama** that takes about three days on foot. They believe this journey washes away a lifetime of wrongdoing.

## The Shiva Linga: Shiva's Sacred Symbol

In almost every Shiva temple, you'll find a **Shiva Linga** — a smooth, rounded stone that represents Lord Shiva's cosmic energy. It's one of the most important symbols in Hinduism.

The Shiva Linga represents:

- **Creation** — the cosmic pillar from which the universe emerged
- **Shiva's infinite nature** — unlike an idol with a specific shape, the linga represents Shiva beyond form
- **Unity** — the linga sits on a base called the **yoni**, together representing the balance of all creation

Devotees pour **milk, water, and honey** over the Shiva Linga as an offering. There are twelve especially sacred lingas across India called **Jyotirlingas** — and Kedarnath is one of them!

## Visiting a Temple

When you visit a Hindu temple, here's what you might see:

1. **Remove your shoes** — Temples are sacred ground
2. **Ring the bell** — The sound announces your arrival to the deity
3. **Walk clockwise** — Always keep the deity to your right
4. **Receive prasad** — Blessed food shared with visitors
5. **Join the aarti** — The evening ceremony with lamps and singing

## What Temples Teach Us

- **Devotion** — People trek through mountains and cross rivers to reach sacred places
- **Respect for nature** — Many temples are built in harmony with mountains, rivers, and forests
- **Community** — Temples bring families and communities together
- **Perseverance** — Like the trek to Kedarnath, good things often require effort
