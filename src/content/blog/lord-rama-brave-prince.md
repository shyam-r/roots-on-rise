What would you do if you were a prince who had to leave your palace and live in the forest? **Lord Rama** didn't complain — he put on a brave smile and turned it into the greatest adventure ever told.

## Who Is Lord Rama?

Rama is one of the most loved heroes in all of India. He's a prince from a beautiful kingdom called **Ayodhya**, and he's known for always — *always* — doing the right thing, even when it was really, really hard.

He's kind, brave, and strong. He's the best big brother, the best friend, and the best husband. When you see a picture of a handsome prince holding a golden bow with a gentle smile, that's Rama!

## A Prince Goes to the Forest

Rama was supposed to become king. Everyone in Ayodhya was so excited! But then something unexpected happened — his father asked him to leave the kingdom and live in the forest for **fourteen years**.

Did Rama get angry? Nope. He said, "If that's what my father needs, I'll do it." His wife **Sita** and his brother **Lakshmana** loved him so much that they said, "We're coming with you!"

And off they went — a prince, a princess, and a loyal brother — into the wild, green forest.

## The Sneaky Demon King

Deep in the forest, a ten-headed demon king named **Ravana** had a terrible plan. He tricked Rama and Lakshmana away, then swooped in and kidnapped Sita! He carried her far, far away to his island kingdom called Lanka.

Rama was heartbroken. But he didn't give up. He set out to find Sita and bring her home, no matter what it took.

## Hanuman to the Rescue!

On his journey, Rama met **Hanuman** — a mighty monkey god with a heart full of courage. Hanuman could fly, grow as big as a mountain, and was the most loyal friend anyone could ever have.

Hanuman flew all the way across the ocean to Lanka, found Sita, and told her, "Don't worry! Rama is coming to save you!" Then he set Ravana's whole city on fire with his tail. Yes, *his tail*!

## The Big Battle

Rama gathered a huge army of monkeys and bears. Together, they built a bridge of stones across the ocean — each stone floated because they wrote Rama's name on it!

Then came the big battle. Rama and Ravana fought fiercely. Ravana had ten heads and twenty arms, but Rama had something even more powerful — a heart full of goodness and the truth on his side.

With one shining arrow, Rama defeated Ravana and rescued Sita. Good won over evil!

## Diwali — The Festival of Lights

When Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana finally came home to Ayodhya after fourteen long years, the people were so happy that they lit thousands and thousands of little oil lamps called **diyas** to welcome them back.

The whole kingdom glowed with light! And that's why we celebrate **Diwali** — the festival of lights — every year. Every diya you light is a way of saying, "Welcome home, Rama!"
