Have you ever noticed a symbol that looks like a cross with bent arms at a Hindu temple, a wedding, or during a puja ceremony? That's the **Swastika** — and it's one of the oldest and most sacred symbols in Hinduism!

## What Does the Swastika Mean?

The word "Swastika" comes from the Sanskrit word **"Svastika"**, which means **"that which is good"** or **"well-being."** It's made of two parts:

- **Su** — good, well
- **Asti** — it is, to be

So when Hindus draw a swastika, they're wishing for **goodness, prosperity, and good fortune**. It's like writing a blessing!

## A Symbol That's Thousands of Years Old

The Hindu swastika is incredibly ancient — it has been used for over **5,000 years**, making it one of the oldest symbols still used today. It appears in:

- **Ancient temples** carved in stone
- **Sacred scriptures** written on palm leaves
- **Pottery and art** from the Indus Valley civilization

Long before anyone misused this symbol, it was a sign of peace, good luck, and the sun's energy. Hindu families have passed down this tradition for hundreds of generations.

## What Do the Arms Mean?

The four arms of the swastika point in four directions, and each has a meaning:

- **North** — Prosperity and wealth
- **East** — New beginnings and sunrise
- **South** — Success and achievement
- **West** — Fulfillment and completion

Together, the four arms represent the cycle of life and the universe spinning in harmony. Some also say they represent the four Vedas — the oldest Hindu sacred texts.

## Where You'll See the Swastika

Hindu families use the swastika everywhere good fortune is needed:

- **Doorways** — Drawn at the entrance of homes to invite blessings
- **Weddings** — Painted on decorations and invitation cards
- **Puja ceremonies** — Drawn on the floor or altar before prayers
- **New beginnings** — When starting a business, moving to a new house, or buying something important
- **Diwali** — Often drawn alongside rangoli patterns and diyas
- **Account books** — Merchants draw it on the first page of new ledgers for good luck

## The Swastika and Lord Ganesha

The swastika is closely connected to **Lord Ganesha**, the remover of obstacles. You'll often see the swastika drawn alongside Ganesha's image at the start of any new venture. Both represent clearing the path for success and good fortune.

## Fun Facts
