Have you ever wondered why families light oil lamps and candles during Diwali? It's to welcome **Goddess Lakshmi** — the goddess who brings good fortune, happiness, and abundance to every home!

## Who Is Goddess Lakshmi?

Lakshmi is the Hindu goddess of wealth, beauty, and good fortune. But "wealth" doesn't just mean money — it also means having a loving family, good friends, knowledge, and kindness in your heart.

You can recognize Lakshmi easily: she wears **beautiful red and gold clothes**, stands on a **lotus flower**, and has **gold coins flowing from her hands**.

## Standing on a Lotus

The lotus flower is very special. It grows in muddy water, but the flower itself is always clean and beautiful. Lakshmi standing on a lotus means that even when things are messy or hard, beauty and goodness can bloom.

That's a pretty amazing lesson, isn't it?

## Lakshmi's Four Hands

Goddess Lakshmi has four hands, and each one means something different:

1. **Dharma** — Doing the right thing
2. **Artha** — Having what you need
3. **Kama** — Finding happiness
4. **Moksha** — Inner peace and freedom

So Lakshmi doesn't just give you things — she helps you live a complete, good life.

## Lakshmi and Diwali

Diwali — the Festival of Lights — is Lakshmi's most special time. Families clean their houses until everything sparkles, light rows of oil lamps called **diyas**, and pray to Lakshmi to visit their home.

Why all the cleaning? Because there's a saying that **Lakshmi visits clean, bright homes**. So during Diwali, everyone makes their house as welcoming as possible!

Here's how you can welcome Lakshmi during Diwali:
- Help clean and tidy your room
- Light a diya or candle with your family
- Make rangoli patterns at the entrance with colored powder
- Share sweets with neighbors and friends

## The Churning of the Ocean

One of Lakshmi's most famous stories is about the **Samudra Manthan** — the churning of the cosmic ocean. Gods and demons worked together to churn the ocean to find special treasures.

Out of the swirling ocean, many amazing things appeared — and the most beautiful of all was **Goddess Lakshmi**, rising from the water on a lotus flower. She chose Lord Vishnu as her companion because he was the most virtuous.

## What Lakshmi Teaches Us

- **Be generous** — Lakshmi is always giving, and she favors people who share with others.
- **Work hard** — Good things come to those who put in effort, not to the lazy.
- **Keep things clean** — A tidy space invites good energy (and maybe even Lakshmi!).
- **Be kind** — True wealth is having a good heart.
