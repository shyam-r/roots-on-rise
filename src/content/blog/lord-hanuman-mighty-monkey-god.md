Move over, superheroes — **Lord Hanuman** was the ORIGINAL one. He can fly, grow to the size of a mountain, shrink to the size of a bug, and he once carried an entire mountain through the sky. And he did it all out of love.

## Who Is Hanuman?

Hanuman is the mighty monkey god, son of Vayu — the god of wind. That's why Hanuman can **fly**! He's incredibly strong, amazingly brave, and the most devoted friend anyone could have.

But here's what makes Hanuman truly special: despite being the most powerful, he's also the most **humble**. He uses all his powers to help others, never for himself.

## Baby Hanuman Tries to Eat the Sun

When Hanuman was just a baby, he looked up at the sky and saw the sun. He thought it was a big, ripe fruit!

Baby Hanuman **flew up into the sky** and tried to eat the sun! He flew so high that the gods got worried. The sun god had to ask for help to stop this super-powered baby.

That's how strong Hanuman was — even as a baby!

## The Great Leap to Lanka

Hanuman's greatest adventure comes from the **Ramayana**. When the demon king Ravana kidnapped Sita (Lord Rama's wife) and took her to the island of Lanka, Rama needed someone to find her.

Hanuman stepped forward. He **grew to enormous size** and leaped across the entire ocean — hundreds of miles in a single jump!

When he found Sita, he gave her Rama's ring so she would know rescue was coming. Then he caused all sorts of trouble for Ravana before flying back.

## Hanuman Carries a Mountain

During the great battle to rescue Sita, Rama's brother Lakshmana was badly hurt. The only cure was a special herb that grew on a mountain far, far away.

Hanuman flew to the mountain, but he couldn't figure out which herb was the right one. So what did he do?

He **picked up the ENTIRE mountain** and carried it through the sky back to the battlefield! Lakshmana was saved.

When you can't find what you need, just bring everything — that's the Hanuman way!

## Hanuman's Hidden Power

Here's an amazing part of Hanuman's story: when he was young, the gods made him **forget how powerful he was**. He lived as a normal monkey, not knowing about his incredible abilities.

It wasn't until his friends reminded him — "Hanuman, you can FLY! You're the strongest being alive!" — that his powers came rushing back.

The lesson? Sometimes you have more strength and talent inside you than you realize. You just need someone to believe in you.

## Why Hanuman Is So Loved

Hanuman teaches us the most powerful lesson in Hindu mythology:

- **True strength serves others** — Hanuman never uses his power for selfish reasons
- **Loyalty matters** — His devotion to Rama is the gold standard of friendship
- **Courage conquers fear** — No obstacle was too big for Hanuman to face
- **Humility is power** — The strongest one in the room doesn't need to brag
