If you could have any superpower AND be the most fun kid in the village, you'd be **Lord Krishna** — the blue-skinned, flute-playing god who turned childhood into the greatest adventure ever.

## Why Is Krishna Blue?

Great question! Krishna's blue skin represents the sky and the ocean — endless, vast, and beautiful. Just like you can't see where the sky ends, Krishna's love and power have no limits.

When you see a picture of a smiling blue boy with a peacock feather in his hair and a flute in his hands — that's Krishna!

## The Butter Thief

Krishna grew up in a village called Vrindavan, and he was the naughtiest kid around. His favorite hobby? **Stealing butter!**

His mother Yashoda would hang pots of fresh butter from the ceiling to keep them away from him. But Krishna and his friends would make human pyramids, climb up, and grab the butter anyway!

When Yashoda caught him with butter all over his face, Krishna would smile so sweetly that she could never stay angry. That smile could melt anyone's heart.

## Krishna Lifts a Mountain

One day, the rain god Indra got angry at Krishna's village and sent a terrible storm. Rain poured down, rivers flooded, and everyone was scared.

What did Krishna do? He lifted an entire mountain called **Govardhan** — on just one finger! — and held it up like an umbrella so all the villagers and their animals could shelter underneath.

He held it up for seven whole days until Indra gave up. That's how strong Krishna was — and he was still just a kid!

## The Serpent Dance

A giant poisonous serpent named **Kaliya** was making the river dangerous for everyone. The water turned dark and no one could drink from it.

Krishna jumped right into the river, found the serpent, and danced on his hood! He danced so powerfully that Kaliya realized he couldn't win. The serpent promised to leave, and the river became clean and safe again.

Krishna defeated a monster — by dancing!

## Krishna's Magical Flute

When Krishna played his flute, something magical happened. The cows stopped eating. The birds stopped singing. The rivers slowed down. Everyone and everything just wanted to listen.

His music was so beautiful that it reminded everyone of love and joy. Even today, when you see Krishna in paintings and books, he's almost always holding his flute.

## Krishna's Big Message

When Krishna grew up, he became a wise teacher. His most famous teaching is the **Bhagavad Gita**, where he told his friend Arjuna: *"Always do what's right, and don't worry about the results."*

That means: study hard even if you're not sure about the grade. Be kind even when nobody's watching. Do the right thing because it's right.
