Imagine a night when every house, every street, and every city is glowing with tiny lights. Candles in windows. Oil lamps on doorsteps. Fireworks painting the sky. That's **Diwali** — the Festival of Lights — and it's the most joyful celebration in the Hindu calendar!

## What Is Diwali?

Diwali (also called **Deepavali**, meaning "row of lights") is a five-day festival celebrated by millions of people around the world. It usually falls in October or November, and it celebrates the victory of **light over darkness** and **good over evil**.

Think of it like this: even a single tiny candle can light up a dark room. Diwali reminds us that goodness always wins, no matter how dark things seem.

## The Story Behind Diwali

The most popular Diwali story comes from the epic **Ramayana**:

Prince **Rama** was sent away from his kingdom for 14 years. During his exile, the demon king **Ravana** kidnapped his wife, Sita. With the help of the monkey god **Hanuman** and an army of helpers, Rama defeated Ravana and rescued Sita.

When Rama, Sita, and his brother Lakshmana finally returned home to **Ayodhya**, the people were so happy that they lit thousands of oil lamps to guide them home in the darkness. That's why we light lamps on Diwali — to celebrate their homecoming!

## How Families Celebrate

### Cleaning and Decorating

Before Diwali, families clean their homes from top to bottom. Why? Because **Goddess Lakshmi** — the goddess of wealth and good fortune — visits clean, bright homes during Diwali!

Families also create **rangoli** — colorful patterns made on the ground using colored powder, flower petals, or rice. These beautiful designs welcome guests and good luck.

### Lighting Diyas

A **diya** is a small clay oil lamp with a cotton wick. Families light rows of diyas on windowsills, doorsteps, balconies, and around their homes. The warm, flickering glow of dozens of diyas is truly magical.

Today, many families also use electric lights and candles, but the traditional diya remains the heart of Diwali.

### Sweets and Food

Diwali means **amazing food**! Families make special sweets like:

- **Ladoo** — round, golden sweet balls
- **Barfi** — creamy milk-based sweets in many flavors
- **Jalebi** — bright orange, crispy, syrupy spirals

Sharing sweets with neighbors, friends, and family is one of the best parts of Diwali!

### Fireworks and Fun

On Diwali night, the sky lights up with fireworks. Sparklers, fountains, and rockets fill the air with color and excitement. It's the most spectacular light show of the year!

Diwali isn't just celebrated in India — families celebrate it in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and dozens of other countries. It's one of the most widely celebrated festivals on Earth!
