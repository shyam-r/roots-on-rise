        Welcome to our world of cultural exploration! We're so glad you're here.
      </p>

      <p class="text-dark/80 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Roots On Rise began with a simple desire: to share the rich cultural heritage of <em>India (Bharat)</em> with our children. As parents raising kids far from our homeland, we found ourselves telling stories about our mythology, our many Gods and Goddesses, and the timeless wisdom of our ancestors.
      </p>

      <div class="bg-tertiary p-8 rounded-lg my-8">
        <p class="text-dark/80 text-lg leading-relaxed italic">
          "We realized that most products - books, games, and related materials - did not spark curiosity in children to learn more about India, and did not evoke pride in our rich civilization."
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-dark/80 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        This inspired us to create our first children's illustration book, <strong class="text-primary">"The Marvelous Hindu Deities"</strong>, which quickly became a favorite with our kids and many others like them.
      </p>

      <p class="text-dark/80 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Encouraged by the book's popularity and driven by a deep passion for sharing our rich South Asian heritage and culture with the world, we created <strong>Roots On Rise</strong> — a platform to unveil cultural treasures through playful learning and personal discovery.
