        Welcome to our world of cultural exploration! I'm so glad you are here.

      <p class="text-dark/80 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I am <strong class="text-primary">Krithika</strong>. I play many roles in life, but the one I'm most proud of is to be the mother to my two lovely, beautiful daughters <strong>Aarna & Aira</strong>. As a new mother, I soon found myself teaching my young girls about the rich cultural heritage of the land I come from - <em>India (Bharat)</em>, and telling them stories about our mythology, our many Gods and Goddesses.

          "I soon realized that most products - books, games, and related products did not spark curiosity in children to learn more about India, and did not evoke pride in our rich civilization."
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-dark/80 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        This drove me to write my first Children's Illustration book <strong class="text-primary">"The Marvelous Hindu Deities"</strong>, which quickly became a favorite with my kids, and many others like them.
      </p>

      <p class="text-dark/80 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Encouraged by the book's popularity, and driven by a deep sense of passion for sharing our rich South Asian heritage & culture with the rest of the world, I created <strong>Roots On Rise</strong>, a platform to unveil cultural treasures through playful learning and personal discovery.
