# Page CRO Skill — Roots On Rise

Optimize pages to convert visitors into Amazon book purchases. This skill focuses on the unique challenges of affiliate e-commerce where the checkout happens off-site.

## When to Use

- Improving conversion rates on existing pages
- Before launching new product or landing pages
- When traffic is good but sales are low
- A/B test planning

## The Affiliate Conversion Challenge

Unlike direct e-commerce, you must:
1. **Build enough trust** to click through to Amazon
2. **Pre-sell the product** so they buy, not just browse
3. **Overcome the "I'll check Amazon later"** objection
4. **Differentiate from Amazon's own listing**

## CRO Analysis Framework (Ranked by Impact)

### 1. Value Proposition Clarity (Highest Impact)

**The 3-Second Test:** Can a first-time visitor understand what you sell and why it matters within 3 seconds?

**Audit Questions:**
- Is the product category immediately clear? ("Children's books about Hindu mythology")
- Is the unique value stated? ("Beautifully illustrated for ages 2-8")
- Is the audience obvious? ("For parents sharing heritage with their children")

**Current Homepage Check:**
```
Above the fold, verify:
□ Product type is crystal clear
□ Age range is visible
□ Primary benefit is stated (not just features)
□ Visual shows the actual product
```

**Strong Value Prop Formula:**
```
[Product] that helps [audience] [achieve benefit] through [unique method].

Example: "Beautifully illustrated children's books that help parents
share Hindu heritage with their kids through engaging stories and
age-appropriate mythology."
```

### 2. Headline Effectiveness

**Headline Audit:**
- [ ] Specific, not generic (could a competitor use this headline?)
- [ ] Speaks to parent/buyer, not just child
- [ ] Includes emotional benefit, not just functional

**Weak vs Strong Examples:**
| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Children's Books" | "Share Your Heritage Through Stories" |
| "Hindu Mythology Books" | "The Bedtime Stories You Wished You Had" |
| "Shop Our Collection" | "Books Loved by 500+ Families Worldwide" |

**Test:** Read headline aloud. Does it make you feel something?

### 3. CTA Placement & Copy

**Amazon Button Optimization:**

Current: "Buy on Amazon" / "Shop on Amazon"

**Stronger Alternatives:**
- "Get It With Prime Delivery" (leverages Amazon trust)
- "Read Reviews on Amazon" (lower commitment, still clicks)
- "See Inside on Amazon" (curiosity-driven)
- "Order Now — Ships Free with Prime"

**CTA Checklist:**
- [ ] Primary CTA visible without scrolling on mobile
- [ ] Button uses Amazon orange (#FF9900) for recognition
- [ ] CTA appears at multiple scroll points (not just bottom)
- [ ] Each book card has its own CTA (don't make users hunt)

**Strategic CTA Placement:**
```
1. Hero section — Primary book CTA
2. After each product description — Format-specific CTAs
3. After testimonials — Social-proof-boosted CTA
4. Sticky mobile footer — Always-visible CTA
```

### 4. Visual Hierarchy

**Scanability Test:** Can someone understand the page in 5 seconds of scrolling?

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Most important content is largest/boldest
- [ ] Clear visual breaks between sections
- [ ] Product images are hero-sized, not thumbnails
- [ ] Price is visible near product (not hidden)
- [ ] Format options (Board Book, Paperback, Kindle) are scannable

**Information Priority (top to bottom):**
1. What it is (hero + headline)
2. Who it's for (age range, audience)
3. Why it's special (benefits, not features)
4. Social proof (testimonials, reviews)
5. How to get it (CTA)

### 5. Trust Signals & Social Proof

**For Affiliate Sites, Trust is Everything**

**Required Trust Elements:**
- [ ] Amazon review count displayed ("4.8★ from 200+ reviews")
- [ ] Testimonial quotes with names
- [ ] "As seen on" or press mentions (if any)
- [ ] Real product photos (not just mockups)
- [ ] Clear return policy messaging ("Amazon's 30-day returns")

**Testimonial Optimization:**
```
Weak: "Great book!" — Amazon Customer

Strong: "My 4-year-old asks for this every night. Finally, a book
that makes learning about our heritage fun!" — Priya M., mother of 2
```

**Trust Signals to Add:**
- Total books sold / families reached
- Countries shipped to
- Years in business
- Author/founder credentials

### 6. Objection Handling

**Common Objections for This Product:**

| Objection | How to Address |
|-----------|----------------|
| "Is it age-appropriate?" | Clear age range badges, sample pages |
| "Will my non-Hindu spouse approve?" | "Accessible to all families" messaging |
| "Is the quality good?" | Real photos, durability mentions |
| "Why not just get it on Amazon directly?" | Show value-add (curated, explained) |
| "Which format should I choose?" | Comparison table with recommendations |

**FAQ Section (Currently Missing):**
Add FAQ with these questions:
1. What age is this book best for?
2. What's the difference between board book and paperback?
3. Is this appropriate for non-Hindu families?
4. How long does shipping take?
5. Can I preview pages before buying?

### 7. Friction Points

**Identify and Remove:**
- [ ] No autoplay videos blocking content
- [ ] No popups on first visit
- [ ] No required email before seeing products
- [ ] Fast page load (< 3s)
- [ ] Mobile-friendly tap targets
- [ ] Clear navigation to all products

**Amazon Link Friction:**
- [ ] Links open in new tab (don't lose the visitor)
- [ ] Affiliate tag is properly appended
- [ ] Deep links go to specific product (not homepage)
